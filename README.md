Light and Dark Mode

Try it! - https://light-and-dark-theme.github.io/

This JavaScript app is designed for use in web browsers and allows users to toggle between light and dark mode on a web page. 
It uses localStorage to save the user's preferred theme and applies it whenever the page is reloaded. 
When the toggle switch is clicked, the app changes the page's theme to the opposite setting and updates the relevant elements' styles accordingly.
